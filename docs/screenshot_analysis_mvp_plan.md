### Core API Endpoints (AI-Generated)
```python
# Week 1 deliverables
POST /api/screenshot/upload      # File upload + validation
POST /api/screenshot/analyze     # GPT-4 Vision analysis
GET  /api/funds/{fund_code}      # Fund data lookup
POST /api/portfolio/analyze      # Risk analysis
GET  /api/assistant/response     # AI assistant responses
POST /api/tts/speak             # Text-to-speech
```

## 📊 AI-Generated Components Priority

### High Priority (Week 1-2)
1. **Screenshot Upload Component** → AI generates drag-drop interface
2. **GPT-4 Vision Service** → AI generates parsing logic
3. **Akshare Integration** → AI generates data fetching
4. **Basic Assistant UI** → AI generates conversation interface

### Medium Priority (Week 3)
1. **Interactive Charts** → AI generates Chart.js configurations
2. **Portfolio Risk Calculator** → AI generates financial algorithms
3. **Beautiful Animations** → AI generates Framer Motion code

### Nice-to-Have (Week 4)
1. **Voice Responses** → AI generates TTS integration
2. **Advanced Analytics** → AI generates complex calculations
3. **Performance Optimization** → AI generates caching strategies

## 🚀 Daily AI Assistance Workflow

### Morning (30 minutes)
```bash
# Generate today's code structure
cursor: "Generate the following components for screenshot analysis..."
claude: "Create FastAPI endpoints for fund data processing..."
```

### Development (6 hours)
- Use Cursor for real-time AI pair programming
- Generate boilerplate code with Claude
- Iterate quickly with AI suggestions

### Evening (30 minutes)
```bash
# Generate tests and documentation
claude: "Create unit tests for today's components..."
cursor: "Generate API documentation for new endpoints..."
```

## 📱 MVP Feature Scope (Minimal Viable)

### ✅ MUST HAVE
- Upload Alipay screenshot
- Recognize 3-5 common fund types
- Show basic risk analysis (High/Medium/Low)
- Virtual assistant with 5 core states
- Mobile-responsive design

### 🎯 NICE TO HAVE
- Voice responses
- Complex Barra factor analysis
- Advanced chart interactions
- Multiple screenshot formats

### ❌ OUT OF SCOPE
- User accounts/authentication
- Historical portfolio tracking
- Advanced fund recommendations
- Complex animations

## 🎨 AI Image Generation Queue (Day 1)

### Character Prompts (5 essential states)
```
1. assistant_welcome.png - "Upload your screenshot"
2. assistant_processing.png - "Analyzing your portfolio..."
3. assistant_results.png - "Here's what I found!"
4. assistant_warning.png - "High risk detected"
5. assistant_success.png - "Great portfolio balance!"
```

### Generate with: Midjourney/DALL-E
- Prompt: "Cute Chinese female financial assistant, flat design, light blue theme..."
- Batch generate all 5 states in one session
- Total time: 2-3 hours

## 📈 Success Metrics (Week 4)

### Technical KPIs
- Screenshot recognition accuracy: >80%
- Analysis time: <30 seconds
- Mobile responsive: Works on iPhone/Android
- Error rate: <5%

### User Experience KPIs
- Users complete full flow: >70%
- Users understand results: >90%
- Users feel "helped" by assistant: >85%

## 🔄 Risk Mitigation

### If Behind Schedule
- **Week 2**: Cut voice features, focus on visual
- **Week 3**: Use mock data instead of real-time Akshare
- **Week 4**: Launch with 3 fund types only

### AI Fallback Plans
- Pre-generate common fund analysis templates
- Use simple rule-based parsing if GPT-4 Vision fails
- Static assistant images if animations are complex
