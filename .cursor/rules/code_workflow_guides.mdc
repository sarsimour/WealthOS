# Coding Workflow Guidelines

1. ​**Scope Focus**:
   - Concentrate on code areas directly relevant to the task
   - Avoid modifying unrelated code sections

2. ​**Testing Standards**:
   - Write comprehensive tests for all core functionality
   - Validate through loop check mechanisms

3. ​**Architecture Preservation**:
   - Maintain proven patterns and architectural structures
   - Only modify working features when explicitly instructed

4. ​**Change Impact Analysis**:
   - Consider ripple effects on other methods/systems
   - Evaluate dependencies before implementing changes
